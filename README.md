# MySync
MySync - File synchronization software with GIT-like PUSH/PULL/COMMIT, aka. SFTP client on steroids.
Under AGPL-3.0 license.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT! EARLY PROTOTYPE.
-----------------

Short description:
Whole project is about to simplify the synchronization of project's content(audio, textures, maps etc.) for both small and big teams.
Application uses SSH and SFTP protocols to manage files and has build-in very fast versioning engine(File mapping based on edit-time).
Designed - as I said - for Content synchronization, not code(there will be exclusions so you will be able to join MS with GIT/Mercurial).

Feel free to contribute, there is a lot of work to do(see https://trello.com/b/NxN9L6Gf/mysync), 
also you can join my Discord server and suggest some features: https://discordapp.com/invite/0kfQL9KtL4XfOK7G
Currently only Windows on .NET 4.5 is officialy supported, more platforms will be added later.
