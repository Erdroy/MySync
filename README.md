# Description
Whole project is about to simplify the synchronization of project's content(audio, textures, maps etc.) for both small and big teams.
Designed for *content* synchronization, supports all types of files, syncing code is *not recommended*(you can exclude folder with code and use some github/other hosting for other Version Control software - GIT/Mercurial/SVN etc.).

Client and Server application is designed to work on every platform that supports .NET 4.5 with Mono.

# Features
